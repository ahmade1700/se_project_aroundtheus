- Intro

This project is part of the tripleten course and in it i was tasked with creating a website which lets users upload their images and follow each other.

- Methods used

The project applies flex boxes and grid boxes, sometimes in the same element depending on the size of the device used, instead of rearranging everything switching between the two eases the transition between mobile and desktop view.

- Plans for the future

Plans to update the design and markup depending on the review and in the further future add functionality to the website.
